### Spring Controller Demo

A simple SpringBoot demo application with a `@RestController` that returns
different types of responses based on the version requested.

Additionally, an `ErrorReponse` type is thrown if a bad version is requested.

Check out `src/main/java/org/xerotrope/FooController.java` and it's tests:
`src/test/java/org/xerotrope/FooControllerTest.java`.
